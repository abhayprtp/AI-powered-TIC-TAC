# Tic Tac Toe with AI (C++)

This project, owned by Abhay Singh, implements a game of Tic Tac Toe where players can challenge an AI opponent utilizing alpha-beta pruning for strategic decision-making.

## Features

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning AI**: The AI opponent uses alpha-beta pruning for optimal moves.
- **Console-based**: Play the game directly in the console.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Test your skills against an intelligent AI.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhay-singh/tic-tac-toe-ai-cpp.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai-cpp
   ```

2. **Compile and Run**:

   Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and run the executable:

   ```bash
   g++ -o tic_tac_toe main.cpp
   ./tic_tac_toe

3. **Game Instructions**:
